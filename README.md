⚡ Real-Time Architecture

The platform uses Socket.IO to provide real-time communication between the frontend and backend.

Real-time events include:

Patient Vitals
     ↓
Backend
     ↓

📊 Data & AI

The AI component is designed around patient physiological and contextual information.

Example Input

Heart Rate
SpO₂
Blood Pressure
Age
Medical Condition
Post-Surgery Status

Example Output

{
  "risk": "medium",
  "score": 0.73,
  "flags": {
    "hr_alert": true,
    "spo2_alert": false,
    "bp_alert": true
  }
}

The model can be trained using synthetic patient records and provides a foundation for future integration with real-world clinical datasets.

Note: AI predictions are intended as decision-support signals and should not replace professional clinical judgment.

⸻

🔒 Security

Security is an important part of the platform.

Care-Verse implements:

* JWT authentication
* Password hashing
* Protected routes
* Role-based authorization
* HTTP security headers
* CORS configuration
* Input validation
* Environment-based configuration
* Separation of AI and backend services

Sensitive configuration such as database credentials and JWT secrets should be stored in environment variables and must not be committed to GitHub.
